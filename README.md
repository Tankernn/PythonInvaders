# PythonInvaders
A python version of Space Invaders

### How to run
1. Python 2.7 and latest PyGame are required
2. Clone the repo or download it
3. Run PythonInvaders with `python PythonInvaders.py` in a terminal/command prompt
4. The application is graphical, so it probably won't work in a headless environment
