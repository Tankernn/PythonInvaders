# PythonInvaders
A python version of Space Invaders

### How to run
* Python 2.7 and latest PyGame are required
* Clone the repo or download it
* Run PythonInvaders with `python PythonInvaders.py` in a terminal/command prompt
* The application is graphical, so it probably won't work in a CLI environment

### How to compile
* I will publish a script for building into .exe using py2exe soon
